an led based indoor localization system using k mean clustering indoor localization k mean unsupervised learning clustering this paper introduces novel visible light positioning vlp system using an un supervised machine learning approach two transmitter consist light emitting diode led which modulated with khz khz sinusoidal signal respectively receiver end received signal strength rss calculated sparse grid cube constructed by measuring light intensity different location bilinear interpolation then applied create dense grid reading which used training hierarchical k mean clustering system given query led reading trained cluster used position estimation by minimizing distance between reading cluster centroid experimental result show that an average accuracy m achieved room with dimension m further compared performance two other clustering method k medoids fuzzy c mean however significant improvement over kmeans clustering found
